		<h2>Virtual Machine Storage Repo</h2>
		Existing source control repositories are incapable of efficiently handling the storage requirements of virtual machines.  A system designed from the ground up to store iterative versions of large binary files is our solution to this problem.
		<p>
		<h1>Store Iterative VM Images</h1>
		In our case, we store our development environments in virtual machines.  With VMSR, we have immediate recall of dev environments for any purpose.
		<p>		
		<h1>Efficiant storage of overlapping data</h1>
		Data is hashed and duplicate sectors are linked. 
		<p>	
		<h1>Fast Checkout and Binary Diffing</h1>

		<h1>remove hardware from the IT equation</h1>
		hardware failures remove only moments from the development process.

		<h1>True cloud computing</h1>
		Get a developer ready for any project in moments.
