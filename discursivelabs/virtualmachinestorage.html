		<h2>Virtual Machine Storage Repo</h2>
		Existing source control repositories are incapable of efficiently handling the storage requirements of virtual machines.  A system designed from the ground up to store iterative versions of large binary files is our solution to this problem.
		<p>
		<h1>Store Iterative VM Images</h1>
		In our case, we store our development environments in virtual machines.  With VMSR, we have immediate recall of dev environments for any purpose.
		<p>		
		<h1>Efficiant storage of overlapping data</h1>
		Data is hashed and duplicate sectors are linked. Large binary files with small differences are efficiently stored and buffered for quick transfer and high user availability.
		<p>	
		<h1>Fast Checkout and Binary Diffing</h1>
		As binary files are stored as hashes, checkout is speedy and diff checkout even speedier.  Users may store virtual machines at a far greater frequency than previously though practical.  
		<p>	
		<h1>Problems with existing systems and reason for existing</h1>
		Existing systems are tailored to small files.  Storing 100 versions of the same 10k file is orders of magnitude different than storing 100 versious of the same 10gig virtual machine.  While virtual machines may only change small offsets in data, existing source repository hashing is tailored to changes in txt files and is quite sensitive to small changes in large datasets.  This causes a great deal of overduplication of most binary files, and completely destroys the efficiency of the system.  
		<p>	
		<h1>remove hardware from the IT equation</h1>
		Hardware failures remove only moments from the development process.  A complete disk failure only loses the programmer the data since his last backup (usually overnight).  Machine differences become moot issues as all development tools require for a project are included with the project virtual machine.  Users are allowed to keep thier own custom operating systems (hello beOS users), and run their dev enviironments as virtual machines or remote desktops.  
		<p>	 
		<h1>True cloud computing</h1>
		Get a developer ready for any project in moments. All VMs may be stored on existing cloud computing services such as EC2 and (INSERT CLOUD STORAGE NAME).  Perfect for the virtual office.  Perfect for low IT or remote IT situations.  A true step forward.
