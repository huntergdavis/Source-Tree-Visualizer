		<h1>Simulation and Training Experts</h1>
		<question>Do you need top simulation experts?</question>
		<question>Do you need top Qualnet experts?</question>
		<question>Do you need algorithmic or network models imlpemented?</question>
		Is your business currently in need of simulation experts?  Do you find yourself starting at a monolithic codebase with no idea where to start implementing 
		your algorithms?  Are you trying to take your theoretical results and apply them to real world designs?  Do you need your simulator of choice to interface with
		your software?  Do you hear the soft whoosh of tens of thousands of dollars wasted as bewildered programmers stare blankly at archaic remnants of our
		pre-history?  We can take your engineers from confused to Confucius and bring your project back into production.  We are simulation and training experts.  
		We have designed and implemented full end to end algorithms and interfaces currently in use by US armed forces and DoD companies, and top simulation 
		and training companies.  As our customers will tell you, we are experts in the field, and provide full end to end solutions from algorithmic 
		and interface design to training and support.  As former QualNet engineers, we have expert experience designing QualNet algorithmic models and 
		interfaces to military and commercial systems which are still in use and distributed with their commercial products today.
