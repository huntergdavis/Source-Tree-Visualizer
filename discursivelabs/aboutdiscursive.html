		<h2>About Discursive Labs</h2>
		A commonly asked question when starting a company is "why did you start your company?".  For us, it was a desire to control the quality and type of projects we work on.  In our experience, in every office there are truly great programmers who rise to any challenge.  These programmers are the backbone of a software company, yet all too often they languish on simple day to day tasks.  Discursive Labs was founded on the idea that truly great programmers can acomplish things which typical business processes would deem impossible, improbably, or unprofitable.
		The rights of the employee are paramount at Discursive Labs.  When you come to work for us, you are working for an employer who understands your unique talents.  We are a highly selective company, and strictly staff only leading professionals in the field.  We only accept contracts when the potential contractee is 100% confident in our ability to deliver the contract under budget and on time.  Each employee is vett and tested as an expert in their field of expertice, and held to the same constant high standards as our products and contracts.  There are no back room deals, no hidden profit margins.  All employees know the current state of the company and finances, and are never in the dark about where their next paycheck is coming from.  Employees are paid a fair percentage of income from worked contracts, and overages are public company knowledge.  
		We also know how to have fun.  As former radio DJ's and party planners, we understand how fun a corporate environment can really be.  An employer doesn't have to be just the guy that signs your paycheck.  It can also be the friends you make while working, and playing.  We believe the employer relationship can be a healthy, enjoyable partnership that lasts a lifetime, and our employees are some of the happiest, and smartest in the world.
