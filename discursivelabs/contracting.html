		<h1>Simulation and Training Experts</h1>
		Is your business currently in need of simulation experts?  Do you find yourself starting at a monolithic codebase with no idea where to start implementing 
		your algorithms?  Are you trying to take your theoretical results and apply them to real world designs?  Do you need your simulator of choice to interface with
		your software?  Do you hear the soft whoosh of tens of thousands of dollars wasted as bewildered programmers stare blankly at archaic renmants of our
		pre-history?  We can take your engineers from confused to confusius and bring your project back into production.  We are simulation and training experts.  
		We have designed and implemented full end to end algorithms and interfaces currently in use by US armed forces and DoD companies, and top simulation 
		and training companies.  As our customers will tell you, we are experts in the field, and provide full end to end solutions from algorithmic 
		and interface design to training and support.  As former QualNet engineers, we have expert experience designing QualNet algorithmic models and 
		interfaces to military and commercial systems which are still in use and distributed with their commercial products today.

		<h1>Interface Experts</h1>
		Is your business currently in need of interface experts?  Purchased a 100K software suite and have no way to get your algorithms to run on it?  Find yourself
		facing an angry general who wants to know why two subcontractors' systems aren't interfacing?  Tasked with updating a protocol whose specs were lost in the 80s?
		We've been there, and we can help.  We are interface design and implementation experts.  We have designed, upgraded, and 
		reverse-engineered full end to end interface and protocol solutions still in use by the DoE, DoD, and numerous fortune 500 companies.  From military
		interfaces to commercial backends we have the experience and the expertise to bring your out of control project in on time and under budget.  As former researcheres
		working on DoE and DoD funded projects, we understand the time and monetary crunch your business is in, and work hard to bring your costs back under control.
