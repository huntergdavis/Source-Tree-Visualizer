		<h1>Simulation and Training Experts</h1>
		Is your business currently in need of simulation experts?  Do you find yourself starting at a monolithic codebase with no idea where to start implementing 
		your algorithms?  Are you trying to take your theoretical results and apply them to real world designs?  Do you need your simulator of choice to interface with
		your software?  Do you hear the soft whoosh of tens of thousands of dollars wasted as bewildered programmers stare blankly at archaic remnants of our
		pre-history?  We can take your engineers from confused to Confucius and bring your project back into production.  We are simulation and training experts.  
		We have designed and implemented full end to end algorithms and interfaces currently in use by US armed forces and DoD companies, and top simulation 
		and training companies.  As our customers will tell you, we are experts in the field, and provide full end to end solutions from algorithmic 
		and interface design to training and support.  As former QualNet engineers, we have expert experience designing QualNet algorithmic models and 
		interfaces to military and commercial systems which are still in use and distributed with their commercial products today.

		<h1>Interface Experts</h1>
		Is your business currently in need of interface experts?  Purchased a 100K software suite and have no way to get your algorithms to run on it?  Find yourself
		facing an angry general who wants to know why two subcontractors' systems aren't interfacing?  Tasked with updating a protocol whose specs were lost in the 80s?
		We've been there, and we can help.  We are interface design and implementation experts.  We have designed, upgraded, and 
		reverse-engineered full end to end interface and protocol solutions still in use by the DoE, DoD, and numerous fortune 500 companies.  From military
		interfaces to commercial backends we have the experience and the expertise to bring your out of control project in on time and under budget.  As former researchers
		working on DoE and DoD funded projects, we understand the time and monetary crunch your business is in, and work hard to bring your costs back under control.  
		<p>
		<h1>Architecture and Component Experts</h1>
		Whether you need your software to run on the very largest, or the very smallest computers in the world, we have the expertise necessary.  From embedded linux
		to massively parallelized supercomputers and everything in between, we are capable of navigating the unique twists and turns of complex systems.  Staring at a 
		100$ million supercomputer and wondering why most of the nodes are sleeping?  We can help you optimize your parallelization methods, parallelize your algorithms,
		and even design custom hardware and IT solutions around your algorithms.  Whether you need a 10% smaller binary or a 100 times speedup in performance we understand 
		the toughest problems and have proven experience providing real world solutions to performance issues.  
		<p>
		<h1>Data Throughput and Image Analysis Experts</h1>
		Whether you are intelligently compressing x-ray diffraction patterns or streaming data to an online game, intelligent image analysis and expert knowledge of 
		throughput requirements can drasticly increase your performance and decrease your costs.  Designing a system with these requirements in mind can save a tremendous
		amount of wasted effort and overhead costs during a project.  Knowing that you have experts on your side can help you sleep well at night.  From intelligent image
		analysis and object detection to visual interface design and eye tracking, let Discursive Labs ease the learning curve and lower your cost of entry into this 
		emerging market.
		<p>
		<h1>Cad/Cam and 3d System Design Experts</h1>
		3d systems have become pervasive not only in our gaming culture, but in our business culture.  Manufacturing and production industries are dependent on Cad/Cam
		systems and the same technologies have begun to infiltrate other markets.  We have experience designing 3d and 2d cad programs and interfaces to both industrial, 
		commercial, and military design systems.  Whether you want to add a 3d frontend to your manufacturing robot, a 2d cad system for a naval carrier, or a web interface
		to an industrial warehousing storage center, we have the expertice and experience necessary to change the way your users interact with your product.
