		<h2>Source Tree Visualization</h2>
		Being a company which is primarilly focused on software development, we have spent a number of years navigating the complexities of source trees.  We often lamented that with more time we'd craft a better way to interact with source trees.  Why should only source tree experts be able to understand source trees?  All programmers use them, why should all programmers not understand them.  Easily.  Beautifully.  Naturally.  This is the reason behind the creation of Source Tree Visualizer.  
		<p>
		<h1>Visualize Complex Merges at a Higher Level</h1>
		One of the primary operations on a source tree is a merge.  It is often tasked to the most experienced programmers in the company to oversee merges.  When it is finished, how does one describe what has occured to a layman?  To an executive?  When source trees are viewed as organic things, the merging is naturally displayed and understood.  Colors, shapes, and patterns of data mapping naturally blend into known forms, creating an easily understood display.

		<h1>Identify Complex Patterns in Development</h1>
		Using current source code interactions, how do you visualize the work each individual programmer or team has put in.  How do you know how to allocate resourcs without a complete picture of the source repository.  What was once impossible is now easy for programmers and VPs alike.
		<p>	
		<h1>Spot Bottlenecks and Dead Branches</h1>
		Map data sets and custom data sources to tree visualization.  View your tree history as a true historic video, with easy to identify patterns and insights into your REAL development process.  Prevent future issues by future-proofing branches and features in your codebase BEFORE they fail.  Maximize the efficiency of your programmers and easily spot bottlenecks in source development.  Spot the places in production a new programmer would maximally improve process.
		<p>	
		<h1>Beautifully display your source code development</h1>
		Display your source code in a beautiful way.  Show your customers and investors the maturity of your product without showing your IP. 
		<p>	
		<h1>Get people interested in your project</h1>
		Publically display your tree.  Share your tree with others.  Get people interested in your tree.  Easily show the difference and quality of your development process, without boring them to death!
		<p>	 
		<h1>Quickly Demonstrate the Maturity of your Project</h1>
		Source tree vis can be used as a metric of source code complexity.  Current known mature software products have known patterns.  These are displayed across many industries, and many languages.  Show your customers and investors the quality and maturity of your software project.  Protect your ip while sharing it's quality with everyone.
