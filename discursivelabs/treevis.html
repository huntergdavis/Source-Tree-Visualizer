		<h2>Source Tree Visualization</h2>
		Being a company which is primarilly focused on software development, we have spent a number of years navigating the complexities of source trees.  We often lamented that with more time we'd craft a better way to interact with source trees.  Why should only source tree experts be able to understand source trees?  All programmers use them, why should all programmers not understand them.  Easily.  Beautifully.  Naturally.  This is the reason behind the creation of Source Tree Visualizer.

		<h1>Visualize Complex Merges at a Higher Level</h1>
		One of the primary operations on a source tree is a merge.  It is often tasked to the most experienced programmers in the company to oversee merges.  When it is finished, how does one describe what has occured to a layman?  To an executive?  When source trees are viewed as organic things, the merging is naturally displayed and understood.  Colors, shapes, and patterns of data mapping naturally blend into known forms, creating an easily understood display.
