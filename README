Source Tree Visualizer is an open source project that visualizes source control repositories as real growing trees.  It started as a research project at my former startup Discursive Labs, but we felt it was too cool to let sit around somewhere on a hard drive.

You can compile this in any unix-like environment which supports a few standard libarries.  See the top level directory for example config files for generating images.

See examplescripts for example usages for simpletree
